# What I learned from this tutorial.
This is the official tutorial from React. In this project I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game with React. 

The main thing I learned from this project is how components manage state and the scope of that state. Additionally, the tutorial showed me what to consider when refactoring code especially when the scope of state needs to be expanded and moved to parent components.

## Possible extensions to project
In the future I want to give the game an appealing user interface and possibly add the functionality to allow two players to play together.
